I was born in 1979 AD.

I think I had colorful childhood.

```txt
I used to go fishing in my summer holiday.
There was a lot of shrimp and little fish in a small lake,which was just behind my house.

Sometime I play the mud.
And it is more interesting then the plasticine for me.
For the mud is unlimited and it will turn hard as dried.
And some dried mud can be polished.

Sometime I listened serial stories from the radio togethor with my father and a neighbor oldman.

I think I had more happiness then the children grow up with electronic games.
